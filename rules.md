# Figma OAuth Integration Project

I want to build a service using Node.js and Express.js and integrate Figma OAuth.

- Dev docs: https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/authentication/

## Steps

### Step 1

- Initialize a backend project using TypeScript + Express step by step, add all required dependencies and dev dependencies using terminal commands.

### Step 2

- Structure the project in the right way - separate services and controllers - and using Figma docs, add Figma OAuth.

### Step 3

- Integrate frontend with the client React app.
